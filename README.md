# Studio Ghibli & Dogs!

## Description
This quiz application presents users with a variety of questions to assess their compatibility with characters from iconic Studio Ghibli films, and pair those results with a dog that is most like your character. The quiz is meant to be fun, relatively pointless, and very educational on the coding end!

## Functionality

## Support

## Roadmap
As we develop this application, more questions will be added to allow a more precise and accurate result

# The JavaScript must
- have questions stored in an array
- use radio buttons to input numerical information 1-5
- once all questions have been cycled through, provide/display results
- have input field for name that will allow results to be saved to localStorage
- have a button to access a new page that lists result

# The Bootstrap will
- help in minimizing CSS

# Bulma will
- create a progress bar that will increase as questions are answered
- improve webpage responsiveness for mobile devices/smaller screens
